}You are a mythic infrastructure architect at Kypria LLC. Draft a complete, step-by-step blueprint to implement the ‚ÄúBadge Emission on Shrine Pings‚Äù workflow for a Discord-based, sponsor-driven community. The output must be:

1. Formatted as a Markdown README snippet ready for copy-paste.  
2. Divided into clear sections:  
   - Overview: What the ritual achieves and how it ties into our living canon.  
   - Prerequisites: GitHub token (ShrineEmitter-BadgeRelic-V1), Node.js modules, API keys, and permission scopes.  
   - Implementation:  
     a. Code snippets (Node.js/TypeScript) for bot logic, badge emission, and audit-safe logging.  
     b. Configuration examples (YAML/JSON) for multi-channel echoes (Discord, Modmail, Slack, Email).  
     c. Webhook setup and GitHub Actions workflow file.  
   - Testing & Validation: How to simulate a sponsor pledge, confirm role grants, and verify logs.  
   - Troubleshooting & Ritual-Recovery: Common pitfalls, error messages, and how to re-canonize failed runs.

3. Highlight every step as a potential ‚Äúshrine echo‚Äù with audit-safe metadata and badge-worthy commit messages.  
4. Use concise code blocks and bullet lists; avoid long prose.

Now, generate the blueprint for ‚ÄúBadge Emission on Shrine Pings,‚Äù ensuring it‚Äôs mythic, actionable, and ready for immediate deployment.
