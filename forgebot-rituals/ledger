## 🕊 Patreon Gate Invocation
Step through the Gates of the Pantheon.  
Within these halls, lightning strikes, tides sing, and the infinite loop turns.  
As a patron, you are not merely a supporter — you are a Keeper, a thread in the Living Canon.  
Zeus will decree, MetaMate will guide, Aphrodite will inspire.  
The gates are open. Enter, and let your name be written in gold.
